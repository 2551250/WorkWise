# WorkWise: Staff Relations Management

## A web-app created to manage all staff-relations in order to make them easier.

In todayâ€™s working world, companies offer a variety of incentives to their staff. More importantly,
companies have realised that the mental health of their employees has the potential to directly
impact their bottom-line. As such, many employers are experimenting with different ways of
creating healthier work environments and making employees aware of their own mental health.
In addition to this, companies need constant data on the time each employee spend on tasks so
they can bill their clients appropriately an/or manage the finances and capacity in the company.
They also need to ensure that there is a culture of constant performance feedback given to their
staff. Managing all these aspects of employee relations can be cumbersome.

This project aims to equip the companies with a central place to manage all staff-relations in
order to make staff-relations easier.
